# os_scaleio_perf
Cluster deployment and benchmark

This repository was originally created for use with benchmarking existing ScaleIO deployments in a previous customer environment, however the roles that are included in this playbook are general enough to be used across customer environments.

Each role, within the playbooks directory, has a README explaining how to use them, respectively.
