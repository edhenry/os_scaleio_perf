# Overview

This role is used a common set of tasks to be applied across all nodes
that are part of a cluster one may want to affect change against.

#### TODO

There was an original idea to run the fio benchmark using this role, as well, but it
should be migrated out into it's own respective role. Hence, the TODO.
